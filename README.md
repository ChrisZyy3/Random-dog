This is the little assignment for BOSHANTECH.

In the project directory, you can run this code to start the app.

### `npm start`

The app will show 8 dogs randomly from API: [https://random.dog/woof.json](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/5qUYCvl0E5u77BG6vhz8csh?domain=random.dog) 

It meets all of the requirements. The app is responsive which fits the browsers resolution. In my opinion, it is better than fix 4*2 in desktop or 1 * 8 in mobile view. The app support common formats and it will display them correctly.

Test case - desktop view:

Test case - Mobile view:

P.S. Sorry, I am in exam period and busy in preparing exams. I tried my best to deliver this assignment by 26th June. 

Below are the default context when creating React app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
